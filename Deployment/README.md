# Phase 4: Deployment via Web Interface

## 📋 Overview
Phase 4 focuses on deploying the trained customer churn prediction model into a production environment using a user-friendly web interface. This allows business users to interact with the model without requiring technical expertise.

## 🎯 What Was Accomplished

### 1. Web Application Development
- Built an interactive web application using **Streamlit**
- Created an intuitive user interface for non-technical business users
- Implemented real-time churn prediction capabilities

### 2. Model Integration
- Successfully integrated the trained machine learning model (`best_churn_model.pkl`)
- Implemented data preprocessing pipeline to match training requirements
- Added input validation to ensure data quality

### 3. Key Features Implemented

#### **User Interface Components:**
- **Sidebar Input Panel**: Organized customer information into logical sections
  - Demographics (gender, senior citizen status, partner, dependents)
  - Service details (phone, internet, multiple lines)
  - Additional services (security, backup, tech support, streaming)
  - Billing information (contract type, payment method)
  - Financial details (tenure, monthly charges, total charges)

#### **Prediction Dashboard:**
- **Real-time Risk Assessment**: Instant churn probability calculation
- **Visual Probability Gauge**: Interactive gauge showing risk levels
- **Color-coded Alerts**:
  - 🔴 High risk (red) for probabilities > 70%
  - 🟡 Medium risk (yellow) for probabilities 30-70%
  - 🟢 Low risk (green) for probabilities < 30%

#### **Business Intelligence Features:**
- **Feature Importance Visualization**: Bar chart showing key factors influencing predictions
- **Risk Factor Analysis**: Detailed breakdown of contributing risk factors
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Tailored retention strategies based on risk level

### 4. Technical Implementation Details

### **Input Validation:**
- Cross-validation between tenure, monthly charges, and total charges
- Business logic checks to prevent unrealistic input combinations

### **Feature Engineering:**
- Dynamic feature creation matching training pipeline:
  - `HasInternetService`: Binary indicator for internet service
  - `HasPhoneService`: Binary indicator for phone service
  - `MonthlyToTotalChargesRatio`: Financial ratio feature
